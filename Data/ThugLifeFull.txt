Thug Life

Thinkin' back
reminiscing on my teens
a young G
getten' paid over dope fiends
fuckin' off cash that I make
nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard
if you never get tp play
i'm hustlen'
stayin' out till it's dawn
and commin' home
at 6 o'clock in tha mornin'
hand's on my glock
eye's on tha prize
finger on tha trigga when a nigga rides
shootin' craps
bustin' niggas out tha door
pick my money off tha floor
god bless tha tre-four
stuck on full, drunk again
sippin' on Gin
with a couple of friends
sayin' those thug life niggas be like major pimps
stickin' to tha rules is what made it simp
and if I die
let it be
but when they come for me
bury me a G

[Chorus x2 -- Tupac]

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry
bury me a G

More Trouble than tha average
just made 25 and i'm livin' like a savage
bein a G ain't no easy thing
cause you could fuck around get crossed 
and get stuck in tha game
and for tha rest of your life you will sit and remineise
wonder why it had to end like this
and to tha G's you can feel my pain
till tha mothafuckas gets born again

you thought I was a game kid
i'm not tha nigga for playin games
I let my buckshots rang
when I pull tha trigga on my gauge
i'm on tha rampage
makin' runs for tha devil
ain't nothin' on my mind
will get me in some trouble
i'm tryin to ride 
no more loves 
for me hard to figure
get a nigga, smoke a blunt
Or is a jury starts (break that shit)
I gives a fuck nigga
stuck outta luck
when I bust
pull me to my death
but i'm a G to tha enemy

[Chorus x2 -- Tupac]

I ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry
bury me a G

[Stretch]

I got nothen' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
went from bangin' ta slangin'
now i'm a dope dealer
all my life payed tha price to be tha boss
back in school
wrote tha rules on getten' tossed
poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
pack a 9 all the time
you wanna test mine ?
don't cry
I die before they play me
from tha cradle to tha grave
bury me

Straight Thug G
kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
getten' drunk, smokin' blunts
a bitch said I was no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in tha dope spot 
never had no time for no bitch 
instead slangin' rocks
and bustin' caps on you punk ass marcs
fake ass G's
bitch niggas with no heart
i'm stayin' real till i'm 6 feet deep
so when a nigga gone
bury me a G

[Chorus x2 -- Tupac]

I ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry
Bury Me a G

[Tupac]

Stuck on Full
Tangaray got a nigga high
lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life
heartless hustler
just cause I fucked
don't mean I trust her
now my pagers vibratin'
can't sleep 
so i'm mobbin' to tha ho's house
pumpin' Isely
Is it cool ta fuck is what i'm askin
Bitch recognize game and start laughen
when i'm all in those guts and shit
prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
cause i'll fuck and get up and let ya know
i'll be a 10 minute brotha for a $2 ho
lots a ho's get mad and shit
I let a trick be a trick
you can have that bitch
cause I doubt if I change
tha games a mothafucker
real niggas turn ta bustas
Bury Me a G

[Chorus x6 -- Tupac]

I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta Keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
Mama don't cry
bury me a G

I ain't got time for bitches --- bitches

[Mopreme]
Just 'cause a nigga come in he got style
Don't think I won't flip it
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down 
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight lo
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked 
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play doughnut
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted

[chorus]
Don't get it twisted!.....

[Macadoshis]
It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the O.G.s do ride
Ain't nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When i smoke you with this mac-10 
When it's on it's on 
Fuck it 
I'm makin niggas kick the bucket when I check em' by inducis
Ain't no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
You should have listened motherfucker when i said:
Don't get it twisted!

[chorus]

[Rated R]
Niggas got problems about gettin shit twisted 
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started 
Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin 
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group 
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer

Shit don't stop [2x]

Game rules often slang to the right fools
Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain while tryin to explain 
why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the same got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gaming on me 
Look out motherfucker homey-G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Get down for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you in shit, for fightin' over bitches
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker try to pull quick
And just cause i'm rappin don't mean I ain't scrappin
And if you clip when the shit happens, it don't stop

[chorus] Shit don't stop...

[Y.N.V]
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped [1x]

[Macadoshis]
See the shit don't stop
My 9 goes pop
Your body drip-drop
Throw that ass in a zip-loc

[Rated R]
Now you've been hauled away in a body bag
Get your Sammy D said how your blood got sneeze me

[Macadoshis]
Yo you fuckin' with a thug yo your ass gets plugged
With this hollow-point slugs
With ya under the rug

[Rated R]
That's why my deaf niggas don't play that shit
In thug life niggas be the craziest

[Macadoshis]
So when you think about fuckin' this 
You better wear a vest
But it really don't matter
We ain't aimin' at your chest

[Rated R]
Nah we blowin holes in your motherfuckin' skull 
Make sure your ass is smoked 
That's all the fat lady wrote

[Macadoshis]
You heard that fat bitch sing when my shit went bang-bang
But it don't pay when i flaunt your brain

[Rated R]
Nigga, ain't no plain cane brothers come no show
In the casket 
Git'n they ass kicked
And blasted

It don't stop

[chorus 1x]

[Mopreme]
All I wanna do is try to Mac the hoes
Spin bank on thangs sellin me a sponsor on my foes 
It's like each and every one they got the look of death
I got my 9 nigga
Don't be silly 
You better watch your step

[Syke]
And pussies we crossin when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin' 
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder rhyme when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!

[Mopreme]
Wouldn't better to just corrolate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks

[Syke]
But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thugin' till their casket drop
It's on 'till I die
And the shit don't stop

[chorus 2x]

[2Pac]

Pour out a little liquor for your homies nigga
This one here go out to my nigga Mike Coolie
(Light up a fat one for this one)
How you come up man?

I started young kickin dust and, livin rough
You watch you mouth around my mama you couldn't cuss man
I had a down ass homie though; we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin forties, lil' shorties livin naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, FUCK the coppers 
Hangin on the block, slangin rocks and makin profits
I couldn't fuck with the schhhoooollll life, I was a fool
I'll play that motherfucker for a toooollll man
Tonight'll be the night that's what we figurin
Hustlin in the rain felt no pain cause we drinkin
Playin them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck that's how we do it (ha ha!)
It's two niggaz comin up out the hood
livin life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted 
Hoes snitched to the po-lice, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin on my nigga in jail
tryin to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor!

"My cousin died last year and I still can't let go" [4X]

This goes out to all you so called G's
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin partners
Don't let the drink get like that y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor
Pour out a little liquor
What's that you drinkin on?

Drinkin on gin, smokin on blunts and it's on 
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
Cause I'm losin all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin with them suckers til my knuckles turn purple 
Mama told me, "Son there'll be days like this"
Don't wanna think so -- I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin big and strong 
and I'd love'm like one of my own, til you come home and
the years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be 
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin back to back
Throwin dogs on them suckers runnin up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor!

"My cousin died last year and I still can't let go"

Look at you
Drinkin got you where you don't even give respect to your partners
Pour out some liquor nigga!
It ain't like that
Tip that shit over
Pour out a little liquor!

"My cousin died last year and I still can't let go" [4X]

This for my nigga Madman
Dagz, Hood, Silk yeah
A little liquor for my homies y'all
We in this motherfuckin piece YEAH
Pour out a little liquor
Young Queen, YEAH

(Pour out a little liquor)

(I don't care, Nighttrain, Henessey)
All my real motherfuckin partners

Yah nigga, Drop the top on your muthafuckin ride
This how we do it on the west coast BAABBBY

Rollin' down the Four O Five
Gettin' high
White boys done wrecked their shit
Tryin to check my ride
I ain't being bootsy
Crusin' in a Six-o Impala
Drivin' like I'm in a Hooptee
car full of ballin' caps
keep yo hand on the strap
and take all the craps
Niggas know my steel-lo 
all legit
but I'm drapped 
like a nigga movin' kilo
Shit don't stop
cuz i can make that ass drop
make the front pop
And Hit the three wheel motion
All Day
Hit the freeway 
take it easy, uhh
Let's slide
And pick-up some hoochies

right back to the movies
High 
talking back to the screen drinkin' liquor
Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer
I'm livin that

[Chorus (4x) (Tupac)]

Thug Life
sharp as a roughneck
Shakin' the dice, we roll long, ain't nothin' nice
so the vice wanna follow us around (raize up)
Got 'em runnin' as we clown thru the town (blaze up)
Another one, had to throw another gun
Don't need another case
you can see it on my face son
But I ain't fallin' yet
And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at

[Tupac]

Mophreme Tell 'em why the hoes dream
gettin high off a nigga like a dope fiend

[Mophreme]

Cuz I'm non-stop, and I'm always hustlin'
twenty four seven, ain't nothin buck
but when a young G's flippin keys for a livin'
Try to make a mill off the time I'm givin'
trippin'

I'm crazy
Can't nobody fade me
And I been goin' insane lately
And everybody tryin ta hold me back
I'm about to snap
You better move back
You know I led a.....

[Chorus (4x) (Tupac)]

Thug Life, y'all know the rules
gotta do whatcha gotta do (Stay True)

Maaaannnn, I don't worry about the Five-O
if they start,
cuz it's all about survival
Just stay smart
Keep your mind on your bank roll
always 
stay ahead of these stank hos 
These days
It's an all out rat race
And look at MEEE just caught another cat case
That makes three
My laywers getting cash up the ass
Don't even ask
Why I'm buck wild ? 
Don't smile 
don't laugh
To the young G's comin up 
peep game
Don't let the money make you change 
or act strange
Stay broke
It's all in together now
Keep pumping loud 
till the crowd 
bring the top down
Is that Tupac Thug Life ?
Hell Yah
Try to dirty up my name 
but it's still here
which way do I turn ? 
i'm strapped
Lost in the storm
I can't turn back
with that...

Yeah nigga
2Pac in this muthafucka

[Tupac]

All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes 
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry 
instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a 187 
do real niggas get to go to heaven ?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'
Bitch don't wanna die 
then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic 
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends
But I'm losing all my muthafuckin friends (damn) 
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me ?

[Chorus]

I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Got them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg)
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Gotta keep this shit goin' on, Yo Syke)

[Syke]

How long will they mourn me
Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted to lack
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato ?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day 
ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me ?

[Chorus]

I wish it would have been another
(Yo Kato)
How long will they mourn me
(It's still on nigga)
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
(Yeah)
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother

Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up
Reminiscing how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me ?

Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me ?

[Chorus]

Yeah!
I wish it would have been another
(Mack 10 in this muthafucka)
Yeah, how long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my bother
(Thug Life boy, Nate blowin' that shit, 
Nate Dogg do that shit nigga)
I wish it would have been another
Yeah! How long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my brother

How long will ya mourn my brother

Haha, coming to a ghetto near you,

I wasn't mad until these tricks me< 
It's time to sanitize my posse 
Look how paranoid these niggas got me 
Cellular calls are being traced 
Since surveillance silently 
Momma chill 
Thug livin pay the bills 
And die violently

Expose bastards I leave em bloody

Ain't nothin funny

Got a nigga seein things 
Why, hit the lye hope to God I can fly 
Lethal weapon I'ma savage 
Still a method to my madness 
BLAST niggaz laugh call em care cabbage 
Read em and weep, put em to sleep they hell bound 
Lyrics will leave em spell bound 
Clown now tired of being held down 
Cross my heart hope to die 
Blinded in some pussy

Living care free 
Sucka free 
Playa haters miss me 
Hope in hard times never catch me slippin 
Fuck authorities they wonder why minorities be trippin 
We ain't having it 
Time to tear this shit back, ghetto children kick back 
Once I hit the mat 
Niggaz will never get this shit back 
Spit it so eloquently 
My pistols represent me 
Bust until my rounds empty 
Back for the street fame

Niggaz blinded by my lyrical disguise 
No time to plot retreats 
Niggaz shiver and die 
Multiple rounds found laced 
In his body and face 
Wrapped in plastic the acid, erased all traces 
Criminal tactics the rap game 
Became so drastic 
Military mind mashed all the walls they blasted 
If we bleed then they suffocate 
Chokin in terror 
So we strive singularize we reflect in the mirrors 
The prophecy is clear 
Niggaz lock n load disappear 
Strategize with no fear 
Waging war for years 
The crack game wasn't big enough 
Ready to rush 
You bitch made motherfuckers get murdered and touched 
I go to jail niggaz screamin 
FREE ME 
Speakin freely 
Conversatin with my comrades 
Kicking Swahili 
Indeed nature feel my first seed 
It gets worse 
Plans are cursed to be a G 
On the first to breathe 
Currency in stacks 
Artillery in the back 
Strapped 
Armies, we camouflaged in all black 
When we attack 
Holla out my set 
Nigga tighten your jaw 
Givin birth to outlawz 
(Ha ha) 
Street fame 

[Chorus] 

(Bust nigga bust) 
Comin to a ghetto near you 
(hell yeah) 
Street fame it's true 
(Only Makaveli the Don can put it down like this, Hey Nas ...) (Note: "time to die" was removed) 
Comin to a ghetto near you 
With street fame 

[Verse Three] 

Positive identification 
Got me rushed to the station 
Stuck in this line up 
Tryin hard to hide my face 
They placed the name but can't recall description 
I ain't did shit officer 
That bitch trippin 
Promise retaliation 
They plan busted 
No man to be trusted 
Everything corrupted once man touched it 
Kamikaze 
Hoping that none of the spies find me 
That's why we bye bye daily 
Knowin cops trail me 
But why cry 
Floatin while we tokin on this potent branch 
Flossing in the thug stance, flipping pockets out inside my pants 
Never underestimate me 
Playa hate me 
See me and hide 
Sure as hollow points shatter, enemies die 
Spread love dead thugs 
Gettin buried in riches 
Take a chance to advance fuck them worrin bitches 
Penitentiary's a possibility, bust and pray 
Wear a rubber so I live to fuck another day 
HEY... 
Ain't nothin strange 
I'm 25 dying to change 
But still I bang wanting street fame 

(That's the end of that) 

Thugged out, Makaveli the Don 
Representin the Outlawz 
(Street fame) 
One love to my true niggaz 
(Comin to a ghetto near you) 
(Street fame) 
Makaveli the Don 
Killuminati 
(Comin to a ghetto near you) 
(Street fame) 
Yo check this out 
I'ma tell you like this 
(Street Fame) 
If the lifestyle that you living 
Got you taking more fucking shorts 
Than getting props 
Then that lifestyle need to stop 
Best to recognize some Outlaw shit 
Cause only in this Outlaw lifestyle can you truly come to 
To see what this life's supposed to be like 
Nigga you'll start to see riches, fine bitches and hitting switches 
Shit 
To me that shit sound delicious 
Street Fame

From the Cradle to the Grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

June 16, 1971
Mama gave birth
to a hell raisin' heavenly son.
See the doctor tried to smack me
but I smacked him back,
My first words were "thug for life"
and "Papa pass the Mac."
I'm bustin' on these mother fuckers ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'.
From out the window of my drop top
I got my glock cocked
bustin' at niggas
when will it stop ?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin'
will I escape in prison ?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance
and if you slang
Then you'd better have your nikes on
Cause when we fight
it's in the middle of the night with no lights on.
Hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky,
Paranoid out my mind
this mother fuckers tryin' to rush me.
Am I goin' to jail?
Look at me bailin'
Commin' out the court house
all about mail and bank
Never die
be a hustler motherfuckers
And makin' thugs out you suckers.
From the cradle to the grave.

[Chorus]

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto. easy

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave
since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild.
Pop pop!
just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark.
Survelience on a nigga every day,
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away.
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet.
So now a young niggas bein' raised by the streets.
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
a straight thug.
Just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gatts
one black and one of chrome.
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got
so stop and walk a thin line.
Young niggas be brave
and keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave,
From the cradle to the grave.

[Chorus]

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say
I made it this far.
Many G's died hard
and all they got was their name here up on a wall.
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land...
as the warzone I got no home
don't have no friends neither.
It's just me by my lonely so I married my Nina.
I keeps her wherever I go,
I love my ho.
Never leave home with out my sugar.
I'm have to plug a nigga.
Mama told me not to trust no punks,
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me.
Since then I been known.
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shootin' at marks,
Get twisted up in police reports.
Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful.
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learn to love weapons.
But now I'm through with money
and through with street fame.
Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave.

[Chorus]

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

March 18th
a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth.
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb.
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum.
I tried to cope loc
but my family's broke
And my pocket's short
so now I gotta sling dope.
In a game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame,
The white man got a mother fucker slingin' cane.
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on.
Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks.
Shit don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops.
I never flip flop
hear my glock cock
thug till I drop.
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times.
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt,
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work.

[Chorus]

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.

Time's movin' fast
will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K.
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did
Wishin' someone held me
but they never did.
I can't take it
will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage.
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me
crazy.
Do or die. Nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck.
You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked.
Nobody cares, it's me against the world.
Keepin' murder on my mind and my tech-9.
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high
then my mission is a walk-by.
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm commin'.
Start runnin' yellin' "evil mind" as I'm gunnin'.
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside,
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died.
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave.

[Chorus til fade]

I would share the definition of balling
with you white folks but now...
the game is to be sold not told
so fuck you.

[Tupac]

I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block.
Little bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks.
And I'm totin' these thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked.
And niggas laugh, 'til the first motherfucker got blasted.
I put the nigga in his casket,
Now they coverin' the bastard in plastic.
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts.
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce.
And gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hos.
Got a 45 screamin' about survival.
Hey nigga can I lay low? Cook some yay-yo.
Hollar "one-time" when I say so.
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry.
Even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
I'm straight ballin'!

Straight ballin'!

Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.
It's kinda boomin' and today I'll make a killin'.
Dressin' down like a villian', but only on the block.
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.
I hit the strip let my music bump,
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.
A need money in a major way.
Time to fuck my BEACH! Hey! And gettin' paid
You other motherfuckers callin',
But me and my motherfucking thug niggas,
We straight ballin'!!

Staight ballin'!

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.
So watch a young motherfucker pull a trigger just to RAISE UP!
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die.
I keep a pistol in my pocket,
Ready on my block.
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.
And now they see that motherfucker beat pain,
At point blank range 'cause he slept on the game.
Ain't a damned thing changed
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em.
'Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga.
Better live your life to the fullest,
You're 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol motherfucker better pull it.
'Cause even when they kill me,
they can never take the game from a young G.
We st8 ballin'!

We st8 ballin'!

To my niggas in the penitentiary,
Locked up like a motherfucker when they mention me.
'Cause you're fuckin' with the realest motherfucker ever born,
And once again it's on,
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they're gone.
Who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.
I keep my glock cocked
I need it 'cause they're all shady.
I finally made it
now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.
And I came up a long way from food stamps.
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire?
What could I do? Pull my trigger or watch my nigga die.
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.
And motherfucker, we be ballin'!
All motherfucking day long, stay strong!
We straight ballin'.
