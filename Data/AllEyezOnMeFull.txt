You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G

(Let's get ready to ruuumbllle!!)

[1] - [2Pac speaking over background]
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
that get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches

[2] - [2Pac singing in background starts to overlap/repeat]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah / Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah..

[2] - [2Pac speaking over background]
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!

[2Pac]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, "Fuck it," cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uhh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
while she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the tele hoe"
Equipped with money and a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin bomb-ass weed feelin crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uhh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin attention 
to my amibitions as a ridah

[Chorus: 2Pac]

[singing] I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
[singing] My ambitions as a ridah
[singing] Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G 

[Tupac]
(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it.. it was my only wish to rise
above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]

[Tupac]
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
gettin much mail in jail, niggaz tellin me to kill it
Knowin when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me, 
and all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin attention 
to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus 2.5X]

[2Pac]
You probably crooked as the last trick; wanna laugh
At how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one, uh!
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin for some love
In every club, I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin
Guess it's true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it? (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin Boo, is this is all about you

[Nate Dogg]
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Yeah nigga, ha ha ha ha!)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

[2Pac]
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
with the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin through..
It's all about you.. hahaha, yeah nigga!
It's all about you!

[Nate Dogg]
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

[Outlawz]
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

[Nate Dogg]
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe

[Snoop Doggy Dogg speaking over last two lines]
I'm tellin ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean.. god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin out my homeboy Tupac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March

Don't get mad, I'm only bein real

[2Pac]	
Oh I know you can!

Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like uhh, this here

[2Pac]
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house 
and can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, "Never breathing again"
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin scandalous

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]

Scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

[2Pac]
How's it hangin? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin
This bitch'll have ya wakin up with all your cash missin
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin at a bitch who specialize in tellin lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister ? in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
and though I don't where we're goin, she's makin me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me off guard
Went in the purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin riches
I'm spittin at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin you could be true
when I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin well
Bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous

[Chorus]

[Chorus repeat to end (2Pac speaks over it)]

[2Pac]
Aiyyo.. how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be
You ever peep that shit? (Nah)
A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin with a nigga 35
Gettin him for ends
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggaz out there
Beware these lyin ass scandalous bitches

##newsong##

[Verse One: Daz]
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
breaking in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...

[Verse Two: Tupac]
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shaking
I'm busting and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
but thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
you, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

[Chorus: Method Man]
I got my mind made up, come on... (come on)
get in get in too (get on it)
let it ride (get wit it) tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on...
get in get in too
let it ride... tonight's the night

[Verse Three: Kurupt]
Well I come through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fucking bom-bay
your got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blasting
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those asking
Opposed to laughing, raw maniacal villian
Laughter enhances the chances of the killing
Why is that? 'cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
your whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
your already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

[Verse Four: Method Man]
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
like Hitler, sticking up (Jews) with German (lugers)
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket — blow!!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

[Verse Five: Redman]
Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
to get the fresh package of bless, the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
to bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out till your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS the rebels)
West, list this, this, this...

How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game
livin in the fast lane; I'm for real
How do you want it? How do you feel?
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game
livin in the fast lane; I'm for real

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin it so bad I'm bout to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin
Body talkin shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me i'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me -- champagne, Hennessey
A favorite of my homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it
(Tell me how you want it! La-dy, yeahhhyeah)

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic 
cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin til the show is over, cause I'ma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
and let you get on top of me, get her rockin these
Nights full of Alize, a livin legend
You ain't heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, youse a motherfucker
Instead of tryin to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others -- Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin millions, niggaz top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
livin in hell -- only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga tell me how you want it

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
on how to get a bulletproof, because I jumped from the roof
before I was a teenager, mobile phone, SkyPager
Game rules, I'm livin major -- my adversaries
is lookin worried, they paranoid of gettin buried
One of us gon' see the cemetary
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin fade em all, these taxes
got me crossed up and people tryin to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin like they know me
Hahaha, but I'ma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it
How do you want it?

[Chorus 2X]

[2Pac]
How you want it?
Yeah my nigga Johnny J
Yeah, we out

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Tell me

Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

[Verse Two: 2Pac, Snoop]

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what??
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now dissapear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like cuz, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

[Chorus (w/ variations to end)]

##newsong##


Hey DeVante
Nigga, don'tcha know we're gonna sow up every bitch in the country
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin room
On the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right nigga
Hey drop that shit boy

[Verse One: 2Pac]

My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggaz I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come, now fire
when ready, stay watchin now figure, increase speed
Make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggaz that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trick on the hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick 
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin you stupid bitches, vicious telekenesis
Am I reachin your brain? Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I wanna be a livin legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin game, with no more pain

[Chorus: (interpretation of Method Man's "Bring the Pain")]

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain) [variations]

[repeat 4X]

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

Line up my adversaries, blast on sight, and fuck your boyfriend
Bitch, I want some ass tonight, you know my steelo
Alize and Cristal, weed sure you heard of all the
sure you've heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggaz to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin, my glock's spittin rounds
niggaz fallin down clutchin they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggaz on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggaz don't die
Can ya hear me? Laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin no more pain

[Chorus 4X]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Bury me that's what they all say, it's time to make a killin
Sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say? Now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggaz from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin it ain't nothin we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptised the public
Now you hard thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin so watch the guns bust
You niggaz'll bleed, fuckin with me you'll be deceased
Never restin in peace nigga, with no more pain

[Chorus 8X]

[Tupac talking over the chorus]
Hahahahaha, yeah nigga, yeah! Hahahaha
No more pain
It's just like that nigga, like that yeah
No more pain
Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches
No more pain
Feel me nigga? Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me?
Fully automatic type shit
No more pain
Coward ass niggaz, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes nigga, do it
Die in the dark, no more pain

Death Row, so what you motherfuckers do?
Hey that's DeVante droppin that beat like that BEYATCH
In case you wonderin
And jealous niggaz, hahaha, see y'all niggaz
Motherfuckin niggaz are shit
Hey

[chorus being whispered in the background]
Westsiiiiiide! Death to everybody that ain't down with me
That's on, feel me? Hahaha
Oh yeah, to the cowards, you know what I mean
Just feel that, Thug Life, shit don't stop
Motherfuckers got Downs Syndrome, motherfuckers
Weak ass niggaz, skanless cunts, fuckin C.E..O.'s
Put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Put your mouth on the pistol!
Hahahaha, yeah nigga no more pain
Prison ain't changed me nigga, it made me worse
Feel me nigga, haha
No more pain
Hey DeVante I'm givin these motherfuckers choices
Niggaz can roll with us, or they can be rolled under us
That's on you nigga, what you wanna do?
Last year we was lettin these niggaz kick up dust
This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiiiide!


##newsong##

Ahh, Suge what I tell you nigga,

I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas chest, right
Watch this, hey Quik let me see them binoculars, nigga
The binoculars

Ha ha ha ha, yeah nigga time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
cause its gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side
The real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real mutha-fuckas
and there's gonna be some pussys
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussys are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends
But in real life they your enemies
And then you got some mutha-fuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
Its a dirty game y'all
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1 its a emergency cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
when I deliver
Criminal lyrics
from a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, thats what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe untill the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
untill the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men

[Chorus]

The Heartz of Men

My lyrical verse with so much pain
that to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
and five-o, get your lights on, fight long
tonights gonna be a fuckin' fight
so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this 'til the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villian if ya let me
I'll Muthafuck ya
if ya do upset me
tell the cops to come and get me
rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men

[Chorus]

In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men

To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear
my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year
like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is having problems
smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
scar'd up
but still flowing
energized and still going
Uhh, can it be fate
that makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward cuz they evil and fake
What will it take ?
Give me that bass line
I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
cause I've been sent
The heartz of men

Bury me smilin'

so I can write about my life of sin

and brothas miss ya while your gone

Only God can judge me, is that right?
[synth voice] Only God can judge me now
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'ma blind man doin time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for
Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me

[Chorus: 2Pac]

[synth voice] Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
[synth voice] Only God
Hahahahahahahaha
[synth + Pac] Only God can judge me, only God can judge
[synth cont.] me, only God
Only God can judge me
[synth + Pac] Only God can judge me
And only God can
[synth voice] Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
[synth + Pac] Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
[synth voice] Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[heart monitor: long beep]
Flatline!

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

I hear the doctor standing over me [heart monitor: beeping slowly]
screamin I can make it 
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked 
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killin me [beeping sound stops]
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies 
I wake up stranglin, danglin my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss 
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care? 
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward 
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state 
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate 
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped 
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped 
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that it's
a million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me

[Chorus w/ variations]

[Interlude: 2Pac]

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real) 
and I don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live

[Verse Three: Rappin 4-Tay, Tupac]

Pac I feel ya, keep servin it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin them niggaz, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
to get your safe, knowin you on that paper chase 
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown 
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin lavish like a player all day 
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me

[Chorus w/ variations]

[4Tay] Only God main
[2Pac] That right?
[4Tay] That's real
[2Pac] Hahahahahaha
[4Tay] Fuck everybody else, yaknowhatI'msayin?
[2Pac] Man, look here man
My only fear of death is comin back to this bitch reincarnated
That's for the homey mental
We up out

A military mind nigga

[Chorus: 2Pac (repeat 2X)]

We tradin war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggaz I despise, look in my eyes

[2Pac]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
semi-automatic Mack 11 just to scare niggaz
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday 
and fear of man - grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggaz whisper when they mention 
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall, we thug niggaz and we came in packs.
Every one of niggaz strapped sippin on 'nac (Cognac)
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin till I die, these streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin
Fat as that ass that honey shakin

[Chorus (w/ Outlawz)]

[Fatal]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first,
facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all these 
playa hatin niggaz position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryin to tell you.

[Dramacydal]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game somethin D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And why I do it - the ridin and smokin
Collidin with foes - in the worst place; 
y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us ,in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
y'all be the next in the long line of war stories

[Chorus]

[C-Bo]
I breaks 'em off with this gangsta war story tale
Stackin loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumpin insane
Call me Bo-wl of Major Pain, gun-slang and movin 'caine
I be the nigga that's pullin the trigga
and dumpin the hollow points in your brain
Mo' bigger balls that RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
(?) Never been no (?) men
How we bucks 'em down on the way to the ground
ain't nuttin but the hog in me
Bust off his dildo, killin (?) and keep mobbin G
It ain't no problem (?) funk off
(?) blow down punks with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
and had them bitch niggaz hauled off

[Chorus]

[Outlawz]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nuttin on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscin, and catchin flashbacks when niggas ran up 
in my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard they got to my peoples, now they livin somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sittin, holdin in anger because my parents missin
Thuggin Immortal, got some war stories for ya

[Storm]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawin from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure 
cause the murderous tendencies of my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would ya try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got cha on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin war stories

[Chorus (repeats through to end, getting softer)]

['Pac talking]
War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do

[2Pac]
A military mind nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know

[Chorus: 2Pac (repeat 2X)]

We tradin war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggaz I despise, look in my eyes

[2Pac]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
semi-automatic Mack 11 just to scare niggaz
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday 
and fear of man - grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggaz whisper when they mention 
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall, we thug niggaz and we came in packs.
Every one of niggaz strapped sippin on 'nac (Cognac)
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin till I die, these streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin
Fat as that ass that honey shakin

[Chorus (w/ Outlawz)]

[Fatal]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first,
facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all these 
playa hatin niggaz position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryin to tell you.

[Dramacydal]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game somethin D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And why I do it - the ridin and smokin
Collidin with foes - in the worst place; 
y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us ,in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
y'all be the next in the long line of war stories

[Chorus]

[C-Bo]
I breaks 'em off with this gangsta war story tale
Stackin loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumpin insane
Call me Bo-wl of Major Pain, gun-slang and movin 'caine
I be the nigga that's pullin the trigga
and dumpin the hollow points in your brain
Mo' bigger balls that RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
(?) Never been no (?) men
How we bucks 'em down on the way to the ground
ain't nuttin but the hog in me
Bust off his dildo, killin (?) and keep mobbin G
It ain't no problem (?) funk off
(?) blow down punks with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
and had them bitch niggaz hauled off

[Chorus]

[Outlawz]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nuttin on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscin, and catchin flashbacks when niggas ran up 
in my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard they got to my peoples, now they livin somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sittin, holdin in anger because my parents missin
Thuggin Immortal, got some war stories for ya

[Storm]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawin from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure 
cause the murderous tendencies of my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would ya try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got cha on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin war stories

[Chorus (repeats through to end, getting softer)]

['Pac talking]
War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do

Motherfuckin Tupac a.k.a. Makaveli

California love!

California... knows how to party
California... knows how to party
In the citaaay of L.A.
In the citaaay of good ol' Watts
In the citaaay, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin! We keep it rockin!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where that bomb ass hemp be
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre puttin it down for
Californ-I-a

[1]

[2:]
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it shake it shake it...

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
The life of a west side playa where cowards die and it's all ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sacktown
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love!

[1]

[Dre:] Now make it shake...

[Outro: Dre, 2Pac]
Uh, yeah, uh, longbeach in tha house, uh yeah

[Tupac:] Hey, you know LA is up in this
Pasadena, where you at
Yeah, Inglewood, Inglewood always up to no good
[Tupac:] Even Hollywood tryin to get a piece baby
Sacramento, sacramento where ya at? yeah

Throw it up y'all, throw it up, Throw it up
Let's show these fools how we do this on that west side
Cause you and I know it's tha best side

Yeah, That's riight
West coast, west coast
Uh, California Love
California Love

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, knahmean?
Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin up shit out there, kickin up dust
[Danny Boy] I ain't...
Givin a motherfucker, heheheheheh
Yeah, niggaz
[Danny Boy] ...mad at cha
Cause I ain't mad at cha

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line 
You was just a little smaller but you still roller
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin at cha
You tryin hard to maintain, then go head
cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)

[Chorus: Danny Boy]

I ain't, mad, at cha [2Pac:] (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin, that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin n grindin wasn't nothin on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we seperated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin mad, I'm knockin busters on they backs
in my cell, thinkin, "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus: Danny Boy]

I ain't, mad, at cha [2Pac:] (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha [2Pac:] (A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus: Danny Boy]

I ain't, mad at cha [2Pac:] (and I ain't mad at cha)
Iiiiiiiii ain't mad [2Pac:] (hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at mha [2Pac:] (and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha [2Pac:] (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha, noooo
I ain't mad at chaaaaahhhhhhhh

Walked up and touched me.

Just cuz I'm paid in the worst way? True.
Lookin kind a good in your birthday suit.

Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips.

Yo, let's stop fakin and be real now.

Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes.

Boss playa when I ride out, that's right.

[Repeat once more]

Oh shit, baby is a dime piece.

Now she can get me.
Hor didn't wanna talk to me till she see my car.
Never had sez with a rich rap star
Till I got her in the back of my homeboy's car.
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches.
Let me here you say:
What'z your phone number?
Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone.
Time for your girlfriend to take you home.
I had fun,
But baby, gotta leave me alone.
Picture in my rhyme.
Take time to rewind these [?] words I say.
If you open your mind,
Bet in a minute you'll find it's time.
Let the Outlaws play.
What'z ya phone number.

[Verse One: 2Pac]

He was a nice middle class nigga
But nobody knew the evil he'd do When he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze 
While puffing on a Newport
plottin' on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas 
But you the only one who ain't telling
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me its a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, 'n break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commencing to money makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga, Tell the lord
To make way for another straight Thug Nigga
I'm sitting getting buzzed, looking for some luv
from the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: 2Pac]

Straight from the Hall to the Penn
Adolescent nigga scaling weight and standing Six feet Ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters 
if the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then thats when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Released with this game 'til its a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear and it ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark getting buzzed, looking for some love
out with the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug

[Chorus]

[Outro: 2Pac]

Shorty gonna be a thug

You little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
gotta stay sharp nigga, play your part
you got plenty of time (you bad mutha fuckas)
You only get three mistakes, then thats life, big baby (niggas craaazy)
watch the signs
Damn, you ain't but sixteen nigga?
Sixteen?!

Are you confused ?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside tha shoes 
of a nigga who don't have a thing to loose
When me and you was homies
no one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
how could you do me like that ?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket
made you a man again
and now you let tha fear put your ass in a place
complicated to escape
It's a fools fate
without your word
your a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga
we can never be friends
I know i'm runnin' through your head now
what could you do ?
If it was up to you
i'd be dead now
I let tha world know nigga you a coward
You could never be live
until you die
see tha mothafucken bitch in your eye
Type of Nigga, that let tha evil of tha money trap me
when ya see me nigga

So when ya see me nigga
Ya better Holla at me

courious 
spittin' lyrics
on tha verge of furious
i'm addicted to currency
nigga that's why we're doin this
I got shot up, I surprised tha niggas tha way I got up
and then
I hit the studio
It's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation
this information got you contemplatin'
heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
break him
and let him see tha face of a mental patient
it's a celebration 
of my criminal elevation
with the participation
I want members across tha fifty states
to keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
will I be great, is it my fate ?
to live tha life of luxury
some niggas bought my tapes
so much jelousy it scares me
so be prepared
cause only tha strong survive
life isn't fair (fair)
probably never knew tha way it feels to die
so you figure fuck with me
I give that ass a try
Nigga, Holla at me

[Chorus]

(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

(Ohhhhhh....)

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

I shoulda saw tha signs
I was blinded 
criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
it's a shame
so much pressure on my brain
while she blame me
Secrets in tha dark
only her and I know
now i'm sitten' in tha state pen
doin time for slow 
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin' 
just like an animal
i'm caged up in state prison
my niggas dissin'
cause 
hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetary full of mothafuckers got not knowin'
picture my prophecy
tha cops are attacking me, on top of me
i'm runnin' from tha coppers
but never let'em stop me
cause i'm a soulja 
hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies
of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid
trust
a no no
love is a mystery
Fuck tha po po,
Holla at me.....
So when you see me nigga
you better holla at me....

[Chorus]

(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)

Look here Miss Thang
hate to salt your game
but yous a money hungry woman
and you need to change.

In tha locker room
all the homies do is laugh.
High five's cuz anotha nigga 
played your ass.

It was said you were sleeezy
even easy
sleepin around for what 
you need

See it's your thang 
and you can shake it how you wanna.
Give it up free 
or make your money on the corner.

But don't be bad and play the game
get mad and change.
Then you wonda why these muthafuckas
call you names.

Still lookin' for a way out
and that's OK 
I can see you wanna stray
there's a way out.

Keep your mind on your money,
enroll in school.
And as the years pass by 
you can show them fools.

But you ain't tryin' to hear me
cuz your stuck,
you're headin' for the bathroom
'bout to get tossed up.

Still lookin' for a rich man
you dug a ditch,
got your legs up
tryin' to get rich.

I love you like a sista 
but you need to switch
and that's why they called
U bitch, I betcha.

You leave your kids with your mama
cuz your headin' for the club
in a skin tight miniskirt
lookin' for some love.

Got them legs wide open 
while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 
'bout his car.

I guess he said he 
had a Lexxxus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex

I pass by
can't hold back tears inside
cuz, lord knows
for years I tried.

And all the other people
on my block hate your guts
Then you wonda why they stare
and call you slut.

It's like your mind don't understand
you don't have to kill your
dreams ploten'
schemes on a man

Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin' 
I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch 
and niggas wouldn't call you bitch, I betcha.

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

I guess times gettin' hard
even harder for you
cuz, hey now, got a baby
on the way now

More money from the county
and thanks to the welfare
you're about to
get your hair done.

Got a dinner date 
can't be late
trick or treat, sweet thang
got anotha trick to meet.

The way he did it
it was smooth
plottin' while he gamin' you
So baby, peep tha rules.

I shoulda seen it in the first case
the worst case
I shoulda never called you back 
in the first place.

I remember back in high school
baby you was fast 
straight sex
and barely move your ass.

But now things change
cuz you don't look the same
let the ghetto get the best of you
baby, that's a shame

Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
and finally be in peace.

So where your niggas at now
cuz everybody left
they stepped 
and left you on your own

See I loved you like a sista
but you died to quick
And that's why we called U bitch, I betcha.

[Chorus]

[Outro: 2Pac]

Dear Ms. Deloris Tucker
keep stressen me
fuckin' with a muthafucken mind
I figured you wanted to know
you know
why we call them hos bitches
and maybe this might help you understand
it ain't personal
strictly business baby
strictly business

So If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch
If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch

[Outlaw Immortalz]
Bow down to somethin greater than yourself trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know
You watchin but you ain't seein what lies before you, beatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
blessed with the gift of speech, the power to reach
each nigga on every street
May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud
of what transpired since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs livin like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

[Tupac]
Hahahahahaha
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggaz that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed, he shoulda never fucked around
with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggaz run, best be prepared
for the Outlawz, here we come

[Hussein Fatal]
They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin ya niggaz cradle wit a knife in your navel
Rap-related criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin Desert Eagle
Till the end, I'm tellin all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggaz bleed, I see Mo

[Kastro]
I be shinin like white diamonds and crystal, glistenin holdin pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'ma last yo past all these Glass Joes
and assholes who claim, like they be runnin thangs
I be gunnin those same niggaz runnin late, to their fate

[Napoleon]
My alias is motherfuckin Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
robbin again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin
But the shit ain't nothin, and I got no time for no bluffin
befo' a nigga finish with puttin in work I betta end up with somethin
I think these niggaz got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin cases, fuck probation
is what I'm screamin when these money hungry cops be chasin

[Chorus: Tupac]

Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!

[Mussolini]
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, riding Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin bitches and snitches and trippin on sets
Ingle-Watts banger, keepin one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini

[Idi Amin]
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin up on these niggaz easy
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin somethin, so I'ma commence
to dumpin stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin, Thuggin
to my fuckin last nut, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride

[Khadafi]
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she drop me
Severely addicted to livin like a fuckin felon
while beefin with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin
Since a short I been livin life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin like a giant, and I ain't lyin
It's like it's me against myself with all these
backstabbin snakes grabbin at my fuckin wealth

[Mo Khomeini]
Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
that increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make em feel a nigga when I'm mashin
Now I'm surpassin any assassin

[Chorus 2X]

[Tupac]

Tryin' clown and get a cent
and so rather

drinking over a felony
and hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't feeling me

and laughing while I pass through times
And all these back stabbers be watching

Just take it the simple game

and These adversaries

cause I'm a be illing
Fulfilling my Passion
Till I'm burryin'

You got me dripping wet

[Verse Two: Dramacydal]

Now what if me

into a robbery
the Prophecy probably suddenly
switch and How it supposed to be?
And Dirty money
Can't be evil cause it's filling up my tummy see
Born in a position
Death collision
was futuristic
twisting riches
But there is only one way to make mo'
so I'm standing on the corner
trying to hustle in the snow
and My bigger bro
couldn't know
but buy a four four
blasting at player hating
wantin' mo'
with a Thug Passion

[Verse Three: 2Pac]

Putting down mashin'
control by this Thug's Passion
unlike them other busters pistol blastin'
I'm asking, What Happened?
To the niggas who kept it real
like they claim to
that's when I bang do

Traveling this road my poor soul
has been consolidated
with all this bullshit I done tolerated
How I made it
can easily stated
it's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
to be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make this to some high dollar gangster shit

Creep with me

so I can throw your mind a curve
while I'll be blowing up the scene
like my nigga Mr. Herb

as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb
so nigga, fuck the rest
you need a thug to get you flowin'
and let that loc see smoke
feelin' the strokes of the nine squeeze tight and slow

[Chorus]

They say money don't make the man
but damn I'm makin' money

cause some of you bitches funny

but you bullshitin'
lickin' them lips

sippin' on some Alize and Cristal, meanwhile
buy me a drink
and get to winking at me

Satisfaction is everlastin'
How does it feel?

while I'm rubbin' on that ass
why you laughin'?

full blown and furious

Now you can feel it

[2Pac]
Yeah -- clear enough for ya? (Is that right?)
(Hahahahaha) Yeah
(Hehehehe) Why niggaz look mad? (Is that right?)
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggaz look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail, hahah!
Hoe bustaz

Picture me rollin in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggaz, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin
Know there's dope bein sold, but +I+ ain't the one sellin!
Don't want to be another number
I got a fuckin gang of weed to keep from goin under
The federales wanna see me dead - niggaz put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottwillers by me bed, I feed em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live? Will God forgive me 
for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
when niggaz shootin at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheamin on ways 
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin
Flossin a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin and my hands is swollen
thinkin of the G's I'll be holdin, picture me rollin

Can you see me now? Heheheh
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a CLEAR picture
Can you see it? Hahah
Pictue me rollin
Yeah nigga!
Ay but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

[Syke]
I got ki's, comin from overseas
Cost a nigga two hundred G's
I'm a street comando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss playa
Thug, branded to be a women layer
So mny playa haters, imitaters steady swangin
Make me wanna start back bangin
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin forty glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin from my enemies
While I'm sippin on Re-mi
in front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
Ninety-six big body, sittin on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin!

[Danny Boy]
Picture, picture me, picture me rollin
Rollin, picture me rollin
Wheelin, picture me rollin in
Picture me yea yeah

[CPO]
Mmm, I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
Cause a nigga straight sufferin from lack of havin paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some baldin-ass niggaz and they slippin in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checkin in the park, 'Pac

[2Pac]
We caught em sleepin, he didn't peep you niggaz creepin?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflictin gettin street sales

[CPO]
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my nine
I'm as cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hog and this 'Pac nigga... picture us rollin

Ballin on y'all punk ass, ahhaahahah!

###newsong##

Ay what time is it nigga? (I don't know)
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here (hell yeah)
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room (hey there bitch, where Suge at nigga?)
Call Suge, call all the niggaz tell em to meet me downstairs
(Where K and them niggaz at man?)
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
(Ay y'all seen my shoes?)
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggaz driving or y'all flying back, what's up?
(Kurupt: Man, I'm rolling man, fuck that shit)
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
(Fuck that, I lost some money nigga)
Aw nigga, damn

[Verse One: 2Pac]

Now I'm up early in the morning breath stinking as I'm yawning
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss player, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alize and Hennessee
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancing with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter just don't bite it
I never got to check out the sense
Too busy trying to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

[Chorus: 2Pac]

We gotta go [2X]
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time
We gotta go [4X]
Gotta go nigga, gotta go (y'all know what time it is)
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shoe, cause we out this motherfucker

[Verse Two: Kurupt]

They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantasies came true, with Janet on, I'm in a Escapade
But did it all end too soon
All the homies running through the halls room to room, so I assume
Since I'm a player like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's Trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak into your room, instant massage, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause busting bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

[Chorus: Kurupt]

We gotta go [8X]
Aiyyo man 'Pac ay where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin
The only one not to leave
Yo man it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
You seem them bitches?
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga what's up?

[Verse Three: Syke]

Hey I'm living the life of a boss player
The front desk calling but I'm checking out later
My behaviour is crazy, from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Caressing your thoughts, cause I'm living Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashing the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blacking out, you're yelling out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream, and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight, for 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

[Chorus: Syke]

We gotta go [8X]
Ay, it's check out time
Ay 'Pac, nigga where my motherfucking, where my shoes go nigga?
Where my motherfucking drawers and shit at man?
Man y'all niggaz was in here partyin too fucking much
What the fuck y'all doing nigga?
Kurupt, go tell Daz man and Bogart and the rest of them niggaz
c'mon man, niggaz is trippin man
Front desk all calling me telling me to get the hell outta here man
We gotta go [8X]
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred

[PAC]
Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch
It's time for me to uhhh regulate

Fo' sho', hey

Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers what's up though
[RR]
This is for the honeys, the superstar
[PAC]
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
[RR]
Well let em know

[Verse One: 2Pac, Richie Rich]

You fucking wit niggas that's insecure, watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me til you sure
I ain't beggin just trying to relocate between ya legs
Drippin wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
you straight beggin to sex me got you undressing to test me and uhh..

Shut me down if ya want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts

I hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is bangin got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Ya fantasies come alive, ya heart rate
shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
but that's a lie, so give this Thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

[Chorus: 2Pac]

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a Thug in your life
Cause busters ain't loving you right
[repeat 2X]

[Verse Two: 2Pac, Richie Rich]

Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see ya blushing like ya want somethin, come get a taste
of America's Most Wanted and let's get into some touching, erotic fucking
My up and down with no interruptions
have no intentions of bustin until you learn ya lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
and plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

You can ride out the spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
and I'm gonna listen when it hurts, I'm gonna hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
that I's the nigga whose spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: 2Pac, Richie Rich]

Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got ya naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing til yo' head swang, I'm so into you
Witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know, now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can addict

Uhh, it's on and poppin, now you seed what I was seeing
Why yo' eyes rolling, Luke seen ya girl I ain't going
nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let the nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight

You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga

[Chorus 2.25X]

I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many playa hating niggaz tryin to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin
Well are you still down nigga? Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggaz every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hittin motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die; live the life of a boss playa
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh - Benz flauntin flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems - my main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin jealous, and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got foe niggaz, and lowriders, in ski masks
screamin Thug Life every time they pass {All Eyez On Me}

[Chorus One: 2Pac]

Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life of a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life of a boss playa, cause even gettin high..

[Syke]
Heeyyy, to my nigga 'Pac..
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin everyday, times moving faaast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm takin off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to servin this, Moet and paaayyy-checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever ballin
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin my business nigga keep on coastin
Where you goin I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowin against the grain niggaz STILL don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggaz don't even know how to act - shit!
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free
Niggaz can't stand me - all eyes on me!

[Chorus Two: 2Pac]

I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high {All Eyez On Me}
I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high

[2Pac]
The feds is watchin, niggaz plottin to get me
Will I survive, will I die? Come on let's picture the possibility
Givin me charges, lawyers makin a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin rough and raw
Catchin cases at a fast rate, ballin in the fast lane
Hustle til the mornin, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin high 
these niggaz got me tossin shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz burnin rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money motherfucker let's get rich and we'll kick it
All eyes on me!

[Chorus Three: 2Pac]

I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}
I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}

[Tupac] They say

[Intro/Chorus:]

[B-Legit] 
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin
[C-Bo] 
Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] 
And niggaz call me a timer
[Tupac] 
I been ballin since my adolecsent years steady climbin
[E-40] 
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin about no timin

[Tupac] That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse One: 2Pac]

I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for thievin I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin
Puttin a bullet in mutherfuckers give me a reason 
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded 
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin, too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin life after a night of fuckin around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme 
then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: C-Bo, B-Legit]

I got my locs on hard hat goin to war
Breakin them off on sight, stoppin lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, Tupac and the Click, smokin blunts, loadin clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O 
Where sellin narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin
That's while I keeps on grindin (that's right)
to the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a hoe, a hoe
get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin

[Chorus]

[Tupac] C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40] Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse Three: E-40, Richie Rich]

Down the steps 
Abandonded broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake although mine was first to ask niggaz
Motherfuckers didn't think I wasn't going do somethin, ask niggaz
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

Check this out
I grew up with that nigga, threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin to ride, double-edgin for the other side
But now, my glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental
Nigga, if your gum bleedin, and you needin
mo' than twenty sticthes, you behaved like dem bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game, check the resident it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[Tupac] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo] The whole clickilation fool
[E-40] Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

[Tupac]
Why them niggaz actin like they can't find us
like like they can't see us and
like we don't be at the same spots they be at
It's the same congregation, Young Pac is back
YouknowhatImean?
[C-Bo] Nigga be lookin all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[Tupac]
Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin, and we ain't hard to fine
Drinkin and shit, fuckin with some hurricane
[E-40] A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboros regardless playa
[Tupac] You suPPOSED to
Sideways to the next light...

[Tupac Talking]

Heaven ain't hard to find
(All you gotta do is look)

[Tupac]

Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, eleviates the hesitiation
I can see it clearly now
catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down ?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation 
across the nation
"Mr. I get around"
My temptaion got me dripping wet 
perspiration
I'm activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking? strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby Listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes

Turn around one more time
Heaven ain't hard to find

[Chorus]

(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)

Heaven ain't hard to find
Infact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of scarifice 
with all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes 
baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask 
Are you afraid of a thug ? 
and have you ever made love 
with candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your bloodpressure
This Thug Passion 
help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that alazhay 
come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends 
perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
baby and you'll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven Ain't Hard to Find

[Chorus]

(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)

You think we all dogs, thats why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact, I wink and you respond back
Look at me 
whats all that ? Huh
its like the closer you get, Baby the quicker I'm speaking
I got a flight out Chicago, lets kick it this weekend
I'm sipping Heneesee and coke 
tho' addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh god help me identify me truest thoughts
your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
Come hollar at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends 
I can soup you in my Benz 
we'll ride 
I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin 
until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind baby
Heaven ain't hard to find

[Chorus]

(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
